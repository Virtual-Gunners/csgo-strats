***Description ==> 
	1 rifler goes palace[player4] holds any CT push. He will push when the igl calls to push. This guy can molly underpalace and 
watches any CT pushing from jungle smoke and clears default site.
	2 guys goes A main [9k and player5]. Both of them hold close A main and watch if any CT tries to push A main throught the smoke. 
They don't need to show their presence in A main to the stairs or jungle CT guys. These 2 players [9k and player5] throws CT and deep 
jungle smokes. Throw flashes over A site and push. If the palace guy didn't molly then 9k will molly underpalace.

help of a pop flash from top mid guy [vanc3d]. Optional: Can throw some utility to window.

flashes the underpass guy [evol] to peek connector and take control of it. Mean while vanc3d watches window or b short push. And in the 
end vanc3d joins evol in connector. 
Note: Its better not to smoke deep connector because in mm we need to play fast. Those 2 other random guy will not wait for that 
connector smoke to fade. So, its better to not smoke connector and flash out connector and go in.

						--:CT SIDE TIPS:--
						¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Sometimes push palace in the beginning of the round and the stairs guy will flash palace for him. To take down the awper.
On weak buy rounds. ! guy can push top mid and the window guy will flash top mid for him.
On eco rounds CT side we can push all 5 mid with HE grenades. Or we can stack B or push A main with flashes.(Depends how the Ts plays.)
Smoke top mid from CT spawn and 2 guys will take top mid control.
We can sometimes boost an awper from bench to watch aps with the awp the other guy will watch short.
